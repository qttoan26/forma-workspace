# Performance Engineering

Performance is a product requirement for Forma Workspace, especially for data-heavy project and task interfaces.

## Initial targets

- Lighthouse Performance: >= 95 on the agreed reference environment.
- Lighthouse Accessibility: >= 95.
- LCP: < 1.5 s.
- CLS: < 0.05.
- INP: < 150 ms.
- Avoid long main-thread tasks above 50 ms during common interactions where practical.
- Common local UI interactions should target < 100 ms response latency.

Targets are engineering budgets, not claims about every device or network.

## Dataset benchmarks

Data-heavy views should be evaluated with representative datasets including approximately:

- 1,000 tasks
- 10,000 tasks
- 50,000 tasks
- 100,000 tasks

Measurements should include interaction latency, rendered DOM size, memory behavior, long tasks, and virtualization effectiveness where applicable.

## Method

Performance work should compare a documented baseline against a change. Optimizations should solve measured bottlenecks rather than rely on framework folklore.
